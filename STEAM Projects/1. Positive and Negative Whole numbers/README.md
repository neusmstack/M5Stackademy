# 🚗 Positive and Negative Whole Numbers – Line Following Robot

This STEAM project helps students discover the concepts of **natural numbers** and **negative numbers** using a **line-following robot** inspired by the **Peano axioms**.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Line_follower_M5Stack/`  
  Contains the UiFlow 2.0 code projects for natural and negative numbers.
- `Instruccions construcció model/`  
  Includes the BrickLink Studio file and step-by-step PDF for assembling the robot.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Introduce the mathematical concept of **integers** by modeling real-life movement of a robot along a line, including forward (positive) and backward (negative) motion.

This activity is designed to:

- Support **hands-on** learning of abstract number concepts.
- Reinforce **Peano's axioms** through robot-based modeling.
- Foster **team collaboration** and logical reasoning in students.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- M5Stack Core2
- GoPlus2 module
- Bottom2 module (for RGB LEDs)
- ExtPort for Core2
- Magnetic Battery Base
- PbHUB unit
- 2 × IR Reflective Sensors (for line detection)
- 1 × Ultrasonic Sensor (for obstacle detection)
- LEGO-compatible construction parts
- Firmware: UiFlow 2.0 or MicroPython (NeoPixel compatible)

---

## 💡 Code Files

Inside the `Line_follower_M5Stack` folder:

- `Axiomes de Peano V1_OK.m5f2`: Line follower for **natural numbers** (positive direction).
- `Axiomes de Peano V2_NomK.m5f2`: Line follower with **negative numbers**, including reverse motion.
- `Images/`: Folder for documentation screenshots (if any).

Open these `.m5f2` files using the **UiFlow 2.0 IDE** and upload them directly to your M5Stack Core2.

## 🧱 Model Construction Instructions

Inside the folder `Instruccions construcció model`, you'll find:

- `Peano_Factory.io`: a BrickLink Studio 3D model file for building the robot.
- `Peanos_Factory.pdf`: printable PDF instructions generated from the 3D model.

These resources ensure easy construction of the LEGO-based robot model.

---

## 🧪 Suggested Classroom Use

- Divide students into **5 cooperative teams**.
- Let them **build** the robot and upload code.
- Students **observe**, **predict** and **explain** the robot’s behavior when dealing with natural or negative numbers.
- Final discussion on how robot movement maps to the **Peano definition of numbers**.
