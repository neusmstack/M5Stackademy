# 🌱 Smart Watering S3

> 🚧 **This project is currently under development.**  
> Features and documentation are incomplete and evolving.

This project demonstrates an automatic plant watering system using M5Stack components and LEGO bricks.

## 📁 Contents

- `Smart_Watering_S3.m5f2`: UiFlow 2.0 project file for the automatic watering system.

## 🎯 Objective

Design and test a smart watering system that automatically irrigates a plant when the soil is dry, using simple STEAM concepts and M5Stack hardware.

## 🧰 Requirements

- M5Stack Atom S3
- M5Stack Soil Moisture Sensor + Pump Unit
- LEGO bricks (for mechanical structure and base)
- UiFlow 2.0 IDE

## 💡 How It Works

- The system continuously reads the soil moisture value.
- If the value is below a threshold, the pump is activated.
- When the moisture is above the threshold, the pump stops.
- All logic and control is managed via UiFlow 2.0.
